<p>For raw lifters, one such guideline is as follows:</p>

<p>4 - 5 weeks out, reduce volume
10 - 14 days out, last heavy deadlift
7 - 10 days out, last heavy squat
5 days out, last heavy bench
Perform openers, approximately 90% max
2-3 days out, light squat, bench and deadlift (~50 - 60%)</p>

<p>Lifters in lower weight classes and women will usually be able to recover faster than lifters in heavier weight classes. (Citation?)

MEET PREP

For raw lifters, one such guideline is as follows:

* 4 - 5 weeks out, reduce volume
* 10 - 14 days out, last heavy deadlift
* 7 - 10 days out, last heavy squat
* 5 days out, last heavy bench
* 4-5 days out, perform openers, approximately 90% max
* 2-3 days out, light squat, bench and deadlift (~50 - 60%)

Lifters in lower weight classes and women will usually be able to recover faster than lifters in heavier weight classes. (Citation?)

MEET PREP

Preparation goes hand in hand with victory. There is no army that won by virtue of its ill-preparedness. 
The primary goal here is to be at your peak strength on the day of the meet. 

For novice lifters, their CNS adaptation and initial muscle growth makes peaking unnecessary. Novice lifters can run their 
programming as usual and treat the meet day like any other lifting day. 

Lifters who are past the stage of continuous PRs and want to take advantage of periodization can pay attention to 
the following points. 

4 - 5 weeks out from the meet, the lifter can begin incorporating higher intensity at lower reps into their program. 
Increasing volume is crucial to strength gains, but as a meet approaches, practicing heavy singles is important for getting used to the increased
force output and load on the body. Heavy volume like 5x5s or 8x3s at a given RPE are also more fatiguing to a lifter than a 2x1 at that same RPE.
Hence a lifter whose program already has an "intensity" day might not have to change anything, but a lifter whose program does not have
singles, doubles, or triples may benefit from practicing singles at 90%+ of their max. Preferably, if a lifter is modifying their program,
the intensity day will be placed on the day that the meet occurs. Volume can also be reduced during this time if a lifter is significantly
fatigued from their training to promote recovery and fitness. 

10 - 14 days out from the meet, the last heavy deadlift is performed. In this context, heavy usually means a 95%+ single, and can also 
refer to any weight range that significantly fatigues the individual lifter and requires CNS recovery. Smaller lifters can generally get away
with less recovery time, while for larger lifters a maximal attempt may take 2 weeks to fully recover from.

7 - 10 days out, the last heavy squat is performed. Squats are not as taxing on the CNS compared to deadlifts. They still are a full-body lift, 
so it is quite possible to underrecover for a meet if a lifter squats heavy too close to meet day.

5 days out, the last heavy bench is performed. Benching recruits smaller muscle groups than deadlifting and squatting, so recovery
is quicker and the peak of any supercompensation passes by sooner as well. 

4 - 5 days out, it is common to see lifters warmup and work up to their openers for a single. I recommend performing your openers with 
someone giving you the commands for each lift. Good practice, especially for the bench press and its three commands. For the deadlift,
performing one's opener might be a little more taxing than desired, so doing 90% of the opener is a very valid option. 

2-3 days before the meet, you can do some light volume for maintaining the muscle movement of the lift and encouraging bloodflow and recovery 
50 - 60% of max for a 3x5 is a sound choice. 

To summarize:

* 4 - 5 weeks out, incorporate low-rep sets and optionally lower volume
* 10 - 14 days out, last heavy deadlift
* 7 - 10 days out, last heavy squat
* 5 days out, last heavy bench
* 4-5 days out, perform openers, approximately 90% max
* 2-3 days out, light squat, bench and deadlift (~50 - 60%)

    it's a good time to look one up and register! Having a scheduled day where you want to be in peak condition 
	gives you a goal to pursue, and the other aspects to your fitness come into starker focus.

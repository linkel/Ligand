MEET PREP
======

>Champions do not become champions when they win the event,

>The victorious performance itself is merely the demonstration of their championship character.[^1]

Preparation goes hand in hand with victory. There is no army that won by virtue of its ill-preparedness. 
The primary goal here is to be at your peak strength on the day of the meet. 

For raw lifters, one such guideline is as follows:

* 4 - 5 weeks out, reduce volume
* 10 - 14 days out, last heavy deadlift
* 7 - 10 days out, last heavy squat
* 5 days out, last heavy bench
* 4-5 days out, perform openers, approximately 90% max
* 2-3 days out, light squat, bench and deadlift (~50 - 60%)

Lifters in lower weight classes and women will usually be able to recover faster than lifters in heavier weight classes. (Citation?)

[^1]: A quotation attributed to Alan Armstrong, a novelist. If you haven't competed in a powerlifting meet before, 
    it's a good time to look one up and register! Having a scheduled day where you want to be in peak condition 
	gives you a goal to pursue, and the other aspects to your fitness come into starker focus.

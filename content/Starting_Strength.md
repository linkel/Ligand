Starting Strength (Program) 
============

> A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong.

Starting Strength is a book and program by Mark Rippetoe that has found widespread use as a beginner's barbell program. The program chiefly uses the squat, overhead press, deadlift, bench press, and power clean as its main movements for laying a strength foundation. 

It is a 3 day per week program that assigns the barbell squat daily as one of three main lifts, where the other two lifts alternate between the overhead press and bench press, and the deadlift and power clean. 

As laid out in the 3rd edition of Starting Strength, the program is as follows:

**A**

Barbell Squat
Overhead Press
Deadlift 

**B**

Barbell Squat
Bench Press
Deadlift

Where the deadlift in workout B is replaced with power cleans after two to three weeks. 

**B (after 2-3 weeks)**

Barbell Squat
Bench Press
Power Cleans

So the first several weeks of the program will contain an A, B, A, and B, A, B, type of layout. 

**Week 1**

Monday: A, Wednesday: B, Friday: A

**Week 2**

Monday: B, Wednesday: A, Friday: B

And et cetera.

Heart Rate Variability and Lifting
===========

Heart rate variability (HRV) has had a surge of popularity with regards to its use in optimizing the training of competitive athletes. Generally, the target demographic of companies that market HRV applications and devices is competitive team sports and combat sports, e.g., football, track, and boxing. Its use with powerlifting or olympic weightlifting is rarer. 

HRV is the variation in time interval between heartbeats. According to a plethora of studies, athletes and active individuals show a higher resting heart rate variability than untrained and sedentary individuals. Heart rate variability is reduced by illness, exhaustion, and emotional anxiety. 

The thought behind harnessing HRV for an athlete stems from mitigating overtraining (or underrecovery, as you like). If an athlete's resting HRV is consistently measured, quantitative assessment of fatigue and overtraining is possible. A reduced HRV indicates that fatigue is creeping up, and a coach can choose to reduce the athlete's workload to promote recovery for an upcoming event. Likewise, an athlete whose HRV is consistent day to day might decide that she could do with additional volume. This enables a measurable quantity on which to base recovery cycles to maximize progress.

Some lifting programs have rest days or rest weeks specified in them. For someone who is used to training from a program strictly, HRV data may be useful to inform her decision if she wishes to skip a rest period.

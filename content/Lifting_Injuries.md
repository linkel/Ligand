LIFTING INJURIES
============

The most common lifting injuries seem to be the SI joint, lumbar, hip flexors, knee joint, and shoulder girdle. 

General treatment strategy involves ibuprofen and copious icing. Ibuprofen reduces inflammation.

Working around the injury is doable as long as there is no more acute pain. If lifting with the correct form at a lower weight causes acute pain, reduce weight until there is no pain and start from there, or stay off of exercises that involve the injured area until low weight is painless.
